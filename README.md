  2) **DWM**: the best window manager
  3) **Void linux**
  4) **eza**: a better ls
  5) **emacs**: best program/app/terminal/IDE/text editor/webbrowser/os i have ever used :)
  6) **brave**

  # programs i have made/making that i am proud of
  </div>

  1) **marlmacs** a emacs "distro" i made because i was bored. for some reason it only works on some distros and that actually sucks.
  2) **ps-lookup**: good for searching up active programs
  3) **ps-killer**: a simple process killer
  4) **scoria**: a simple package manager: still being worked on
  5) **ebps**: xbps is actually kinda hard to use so i just made a little script to make it better.
